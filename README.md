Welcome to the Turtle Crossing Game!

Here are the rules:

1.Use the up arrow key on your keyboard to move the turtle forward.

2.The turtle can only move forward and cannot move backward or sideways.

3.Avoid collisions with the passing cars on the road. If the turtle collides with a car, the game is over.

Good luck and have fun playing!
